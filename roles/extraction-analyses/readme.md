# Extraction + Analyses Project Goals and Milestones

## Stream Extraction: Split and analyze GPS data from video stream

**Week 1 Outcomes**
- Be able to find the parallel stream of GPS data
  - Note: The footage comes off a Labpano Pilot Era camera, and the parallel stream is setup to be used by Google Street View to understand and draw the blue Google Street View lines
- Identify libraries (with pros/cons) that can be used to extract and split the GPS data
- Meeting: We can share the different approaches people have found, and who will attempt which

**Week 2 Outcomes**

- Split the GPS data out
- Visualize the GPS and other telemetric data (I believe height is included)
- Identify libraries (with pros/cons) to modify the GPS data within the stream, ideally within the data itself

- Identify libraries (with pros/cons) to extract GPS insights, from measures like speed to others that you can extrapolate yourself without a library

- Meeting: We can compare the stream data and what people have found


**Week 3 Outcomes**

- Start editing the GPS stream data and test that it gets saved
- Show insights from the GPS data

- Meeting: We can compare the insights and results so far


**Week 4 Outcomes**
- Iterate on the results from last week
- Meeting: Share overall outcomes with one another
