# Web Workflow Project Goals and Milestones

## Full stack web development: Setup "Upload video" workflow + processing

**Week 1 Outcomes**

- Identify libraries that can be used to superimpose images on videos

- Identify headless browsers (using HTML/CSS) or other approaches to generate transparent PNGs with custom text

- Meeting: We can share the different approaches people have found, and who will attempt which


**Week 2 Outcomes**

- Test libraries on making edits to images on videos
- Design and create transparent PNGs with custom text

- Identify website platforms/frameworks to build a site with for next week

- Meeting: We can compare the outputs of the approaches on image-to-video superimposing and the created PNGs

**Week 3 Outcomes**

- Create barebones website that will accept a video and a name as input
  - Input video should have a watermark added, with the name added onto the transparent PNG

- Meeting: We can compare approaches so far


**Week 4 Outcomes**
- Iterate on the results from last week
- Meeting: Share overall outcomes with one another
