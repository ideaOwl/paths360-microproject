# Data Science Project Goals and Milestones

## Data Science Identify & Blur Faces+Plates off 2.4TB of 8fps videos

**Week 1 Outcomes**
- Be able to access video frames as images for processing
- Identify libraries that could be used for detecting objects and properties
- Meeting We can share what approaches are possible and ideal

**Week 2 Outcomes**

- Implement libraries to identify key objects and properties
  - People and Vehicles
  - Faces and License Plates
- Add timestamps and add boxes for when these occur
- Meeting We can compare our implementations and results

**Week 3 Outcomes**

- Add blurring to the videos
- Run processes across all videos (2.8TB) from Week 2 identification work, or have Eugene run your approach
- Meeting We can look at the results from both blurring on samples and outcomes from all video work

**Week 4 Outcomes**
- Iterate on the results from last week
- Run through blurring on all videos
- Meeting Share overall outcomes with one another
